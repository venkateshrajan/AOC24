# [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024)

Bored! I like C++. Solving AOC 24. Not sweating! Don't expect optimal solution here.

I would highly encourage you to go through the challenge yourself. Everyone gets a different sets of input.
Each solution here has the hardcoded input/input.txt with my input.

I have intenally not pasted the questions here. Login to official AOC website to get the question
